# Rust syntax highlighting for nano

> ***Note:*** This repository is only useful for nano 2.6.0 or older

Since nano 2.6.1 a support for Rust syntax highlighting is included so there
is no need to use the rust.nanorc config file from this repository.

When using a nano release older than 2.6.1 the rust.nanorc from this repository
should be used, not the file from
[nano 2.6.1 or newer](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/nano.git/plain/doc/syntax/rust.nanorc),
because otherwise an error message will be shown during nano startup.
See [GNU nano bug #48555](https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?48555)

Patches can be contributed on the
[GNU nano](https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?group=nano) website or through the
[nano-devel](https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/nano-devel) mailing list.
